Nowadays, urban areas suffer from climate change and warmer environment worldwide. Furthermore, urban Heat Island (UHI) is regarded as one of the most prominent problems caused by unsustainable urban development. Urban areas have a higher temperature than the surrounding rural areas, which is referred to as UHI. Urban heat island phenomenon has significant effects on air quality and energy consumption of urban buildings. The current study aims to analyze and evaluate the spatiotemporal changes of UHI in Isfahan during 1998-2014. A mono-window algorithm was applied to extract Land Surface Temperature(LST). Temporal and spatial change in heat islands was analyzed using statistical methods, Mann-Kendall and URI index.  Results reealed that  LST had an increasing trend and the intensity of this trend is mainly in northwest and northeast of the city and around Zayande- Rood river . This is primarily due to the development of the city and the destruction of green cover. Finally it was concluded that the temporal change of UHI witnessed an increasing trend (UHI index of 0.25 in 1998 and 0.312 in 2014) which is in line with the spatial trend[s1] . Evaluation of temporal change UHI shows The URI index has been an increasing trend and its value from 0.25 for 1998 to 0.312 for 2014.# LST-paper
